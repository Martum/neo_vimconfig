# neo_vimconfig
Grew tired of my buggy vim config. Doing a fresh config with [Vundle][1] instead of pathogen to see what happens.

## Installation

~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/nicooga/neo_vimconfig ~/.vim
vim +PluginInstall +qall # Install plugins
~~~

## Notes
Config uses a powerline font that you need installed to display the status line properly: https://github.com/powerline/fonts/blob/master/Monofur/Monofur%20for%20Powerline.ttf.
