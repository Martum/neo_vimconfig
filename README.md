# neo_vimconfig
Grew tired of my buggy vim config. Doing a fresh config with Vundle instead of pathogen to see what happens.

## Installation

~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/nicooga/neo_vimconfig ~/.vim
~~~

## Notes
Config uses a powerline font that you need installed to use graphical vim: https://github.com/powerline/fonts/blob/master/Monofur/Monofur%20for%20Powerline.ttf.
